The sprite.css file and sprite.png file are generated using the SpriteGenerator tool.

To add new images to the sprite, follow these instructions:

====== Add the Image ======
1. Add the image or images to the to_sprite/ directory.

====== Run the Tool ======
2. Run the SpriteGenerator.exe in the tools/ directory.
3. Set "Images directory path" to the full path to the to_sprite/ directory.
4. Set "Output image file path" to the full path to the war/images/sprite/ directory.
5. Set "Output CSS file path" to the full path to the war/images/sprite/ directory.
6. Keep the other options the same, then click "Generate".

====== Update the Output ======
7. Open up the newly generated sprite.css.
8. Change the background-image url from 'sprite.png' to '/images/sprite/sprite.png'.

Note: if you notice the sprite change not being picked up, make sure the gss.bat
script has ran either manually or automatically by the Waterdeep builder.
